## Your Proposal

I would be starting a new course called [CS055](https://github.com/CS055/CS055) to bring interest among students in open source and development.
I would be taking the help of 2 other GSOC students for this course. The plan is to conduct 1 class a week for the
Students enrolled in the course. The classes would be conducted throughout the semester.

## Your Proposal's Impact

- Target audience
  - Students being interested in free and open source projects but don't have enough domain knowledge and skills.
- Community needs
  - A lot of students are interested in open source. But they are not sure how to get started to open source.
- Resources
  - Classroom in University
  - It would be nice if GitHub can arrange some guest lectures(remote) for this course.
- Media
  - We will have all the slides uploaded in the GitHub course repo
- Content knowledge
  - I think we can handle the topics which we are going to deliver :). 
- Timeline
  - We are planning to start the course in the last week of Jan. It would be conducted every week throughout the semester

## Planning for the Future

- When will you review the impact of your proposal?
  - Once the courses finished
- How will you measure success?
  - How many students stayed till the end of the course. Number of GSOC selections in the next year can be also a good measure.
- How frequently will you iterate on your community plans?
  - Every week
